# Classify-Xray-images-of-human-lungs
The task for this problem set was to analyze & classify an image dataset consisting of 13,260 CT-scanned images of human lungs having a resolution of 64 X 64. 
We were needed to build a model that can classify those images into three categories namely healthy patients (represented by label ‘0’), patients with pre-existing conditions 
(represented by label ‘1’) & patients with serious condition (represented by label ‘2’), so that manual intervention is not required for classifying these huge quantities of images.
